DwarfCassowary - Constraint Solving for the Lively Kernel based on Cassowary for JavaScript

This is a Lively Kernel adaption of the JavaScript implementation of the Cassowary Constraint Solving Toolkit.
As some of Lively's libraries conflict with the ones used for Cassowary/JavaScript, changes are likely to be restricted to the class system.

Require DwarfCassowary in your Lively module to import all Cassowary classes into the global namespace. Example code from the html files is supposed to run without modifications. 

The package also contains two required Lively modules (Hashtable and HashSet) that are Lively ports of jshashtable by Tim Down (http://www.timdown.co.uk/jshashtable/).
