DwarfCassowary - Constraint Solving for the Lively Kernel based on Cassowary for JavaScript

This is a Lively Kernel adaption of the JavaScript implementation of the Cassowary Constraint Solving Toolkit.
As some of Lively's libraries conflict with the ones used for Cassowary/JavaScript, changes are likely to be restricted to the class system.

Thanks to the original authors for this great piece of software:
